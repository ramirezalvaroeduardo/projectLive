To create a list of people to get the COVID-19 vaccine, based on requirements and availability, with a focus on farmworkers in Gainesville,FL (In collaboration with University of Florida (UF)).

## Introduction
This site will provide a way to capture person data of Farmworkers interested in getting covid-19 vaccine, after media/flyer/text campaing.
Participants must give the consent, before, capturing thier personal data and have to comply with the current requirements of UF for the time and vaccine lot availability.  

## Audience
Farmworkes and thier family, initially 40+ years old and/or any age with health pre-conditions (Cardiovascular deases, Respiratory/Immuno compromises).

## User Stories
- As a collaborator, I want to collect as much Farmworkers person information, so more adult people will have the opportunity to get vaccinated in the rural area.
- As a collaborator, I want to release Covid-19 vaccination information, so persons calling the organization can communicate to more Farmworker families about th opportunity of getting vaccinacted.
- As an organzation, we want to inform Farmworker of Covid-19 vaccine options and locations, so more people get immunization reducing the pandemic spread.
